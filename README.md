The classic Snake game gets an exciting twist with the addition of an AI that tries to interfere with the snake's quest to collect apples. In this version, the player controls the snake as usual, moving it around the screen to eat the apples and grow longer. However, there is an AI-controlled ant is introduced as an additional challenge for the player. The ant has three distinct states that it cycles through as it tries to interfere with the snake's quest to collect apples.
 
In the first state, patrol, the ant moves around the perimeter of the game square, observing the snake's movements and waiting for an opportunity to strike. The ant moves quickly and can change direction suddenly, making it challenging for the player to predict its movements.

When the snake eats an apple, the ant enters its second state, freeze. During this state, the ant stops moving for a few seconds, allowing the snake to collect the apple without interference. However, the ant quickly snaps back to its patrol state, ready to resume its attack.

In the final state, hunt, the ant becomes aggressive and actively chases the snake. The ant moves quickly and can change direction on a dime, making it difficult for the player to evade it. The ant will continue to hunt the snake until it successfully catches it or the player manages to escape to safety.

Overall, the Snake game with AI interference and the ant's three distinct states add an exciting new layer of challenge to the classic game, requiring players to stay on their toes and develop new strategies to overcome the ant's interference.
